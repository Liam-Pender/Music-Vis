# Music-Vis
Midterm assessment for music visualiser

UserAudio- in order for the microphone to be picked up in chrome access must be allowed but it will also not allow access unless it is on 
a HTTPS: site for security reasons, to get arround this you will need to launch in LocalHost. I'm going to assume you can do that.

volume- this can be changed by the "+" and "-" buttons on the screen or with the up and down arrows on the keyboard
