# Music-Vis
Midterm assessment for music visualiser

UserAudio- in order for the microphone to be picked up in chrome access must be allowed but it will also not allow access unless it is on 
a HTTPS: site for security reasons, to get arround this you will need to launch in LocalHost. I know part of the requirements was to be
able to simply extract and put into brackets but this is a fundermental security feature of Chrome and can't be got around by simple
coding.

volume- this can be changed by the "+" and "-" buttons on the screen or with the up and down arrows on the keyboard

Bug reports - any glitch in the system found after the development for that feature was meant to be finished was reported and the fix
described. This Spreadsheet can be found in the "Bug Reports" folder.
